PRORITY:
- slideshow on the belly
- swiping on mobile
- missing bar graph animation
- media queries (mobile font-sizes)
- placing graphs in the mobile version
- problems with ipad (web view on portrait - no facts)
- mobile: scrolling of the background - modal window not scrolling
- animation of the top-tap falling
- after resizing from mobile to web -the facts are not showing
