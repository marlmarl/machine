PRORITY:
- animation of the top-tap falling
- arrows
- dot navigation
- fact 4 slider on mobile
- slider bugs
- position of the facts (left margin?)




Good to do
- ux - better indication that the valves are clickable
- improving the animation of indicators
- remove selection
- focus outline
- preloader?
- code comments and cleaning
- js:whole picture loading


THINGS TO ASK THEM:
- no-js
- footnotes


CHECK:
- client prefixes before every send!!!!
- machine shaking shakes the modal on web imitating mobile
- woff2 - caniuse
- crossbrowser flexbox support check
- text check (interpunction, missspellings in the org. content)
- problems with ipad (web view on portrait - no facts) -fixed but checked only in browser imitating ipad
- bug:after closing fact by swiping on mobile does not trigger modal closing script - effect:2 modals showing after next click on the valve



DONE:
- woff
- touch the valve in the belly;
- missing bar graph animation
- placing graphs in the mobile version
- after resizing from mobile to web -the facts are not showing (in the middle of fixing it) and also the mobile graphs are showing as well after resising to web
- removing headings and positioning facts in the center
- mobile: scrolling of the background - modal window not scrolling - while overflow hidden the x-icon is hidden, but overflow-y somehow shows also the vertical scroll because if the x-icon outside window
- flexbox justify-content not working on ipad
- bug: smoke not triggering sometimes
- slideshow on the belly
- slides on mobile
- swiping on mobile
- open modal closes after resising
