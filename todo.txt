PRORITY:

- media queries (mobile font-sizes)
- problems with ipad (web view on portrait - no facts)
- mobile: scrolling of the background - modal window not scrolling
- animation of the top-tap falling
- after resizing from mobile to web -the facts are not showing (in the middle of fixing it) and also the mobile graphs are showing
- slideshow on the belly
- swiping on mobile
- removing headings
- mobile graphs correction

Good to do
- ux - better indication that the valves are clickable
- improving the animation of indicators
- flexbox support check
- remove selection
- focus outline
- preloader?





THINGS TO ASK THEM:
- no-js
- footnotes


CHECK:
- client prefixes before every send!!!!
- machine shaking shakes the modal on web imitating mobile
- woff2 - caniuse


DONE:
- woff
- touch the valve in the belly;
- js:whole picture loading
- missing bar graph animation
- placing graphs in the mobile version
