PRORITY:
- slideshow on the belly
- swiping on mobile
- missing bar graph animation
- media queries (mobile font-sizes)
- placing graphs in the mobile version
- client prefixes before every send!!!!
- touch the valve in the belly;
- after resizing from mobile to web -the facts are not showing
- problems with ipad (web view on portrait - no facts)
- mobile: scrolling of the background - modal window not scrolling
- animation of the top-tap falling


Good to do
- ux - better indication that the valves are clickable
- improving the animation of indicators
- flexbox support check
- remove selection
- focus outline
- js:whole picture loading (loading time - preloader?)





THINGS TO ASK THEM:
- no-js
- fonts woff
- footnotes


CHECK:
- machine shaking shakes the modal on web imitating mobile
