CHANGES:

- Fact 4 is not easy to read  -> can we instead of ticker boxes have graphs with a percentage ( the first three graphs would be rather steep, whereas the last would be quite flat)
Fact 4 right now: I would like to see the company name + number at the bottom both aligned to the left, but ignore if we switch to graphs.
- Fact 5: instead of the number just sinking in, can it go up gradually, so it communicates the extreme high number
- Bastien,

Just got back from the test; Google Analytics tag is perfect.
The vertical scrollbars are indeed gone, but for example (in our testcase) on iPhone 6, Fact 4 is a bit too long.
Understandably, the users can swipe up/down – but that’s only if they ‘understand’ that there is more content below.

How would you tackle this? Do we let it be like it is now, or is there a better solution to fix?
Looking at traffic from iPhone 6/7 screens (375x667) – it’s quite a considerable amount.

@Susan, or we can accept it and trust the users to be able to see that there is more themselves?

- footnotes and legends


CHECK:
- client prefixes before every send!!!!
